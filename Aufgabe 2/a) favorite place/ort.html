			Iceland Listeni/ˈaɪslənd/ is a Nordic island country marking the juncture between the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, 
			on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.[6] The country has a population of 321,857 and a total area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq mi), 
			which makes it the most sparsely populated country in Europe.[7] The capital and largest city is Reykjavík,[8] with the 
			surrounding areas in the southwestern region of the country being home to two-thirds of the country's population. Reykjavík 
			is the most northern capital in the world. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists mainly of a 
			plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the 
			lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle.
			According to Landnámabók, the European settlement of Iceland began in AD 874 when the chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first 
			permanent Norse settler on the island.[9] Others had visited the island earlier and stayed over winter. During the following 
			centuries, Norsemen settled Iceland, bringing with them thralls of Gaelic origin. From 1262 to 1918, Iceland was part of the 
			Norwegian and later the Danish monarchies. The country became independent in 1918 and a republic was declared in 1944.
			Until the 20th century, the Icelanders relied largely on fishing and agriculture, and the country was one of the least developed in the 
			region. Industrialisation of the fisheries and aid through the United States' Marshall Plan following World War II brought prosperity and, 
			by the 1990s, Iceland had developed as one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, Iceland became party to the 
			European Economic Area, which supported diversification of the economy into economic and financial services.
			Iceland has a free-market economy with relatively low corporate taxes compared to other OECD countries.[10] It maintains a Nordic social 
			welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens.[11] In 2013, it was ranked as the 13th 
			most-developed country in the world by the United Nations' Human Development Index.

		<p>Reykjavík (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈreiːcaˌviːk] is the capital and largest city of Iceland.
			Its latitude, at 64°08' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state.
			It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of the Faxaflói Bay. With a population of around 120,000 
			(and over 200,000 in the Greater Reykjavík Area), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Reykjavík is believed to be the location of the first permanent settlement in Iceland, which Ingólfur Arnarson is said to 
			have established around AD 870. Until the 18th century, there was no urban development in the city location. 
			The city was founded in 1786 as an official trading town and grew steadily over the next decades, as it transformed into a regional 
			and later national centre of commerce, population, and governmental activities. It is among the cleanest, greenest, and safest cities
			 in the world.
